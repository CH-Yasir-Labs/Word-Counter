# Word-Counter
This Python script is a **Word Counter App** that analyzes user input to count **characters, words, and sentences**. It continuously accepts input until the user presses **Enter twice**, then calculates counts using `len()` and `.split()`. The program efficiently processes text, making it useful for quick text analysis and readability checks.
